# Pinochio's Pizza

Pinochio's Pizza is a pizza ordering application based on the restaurant of the same name in Cambridge, Massachusetts (http://www.pinocchiospizza.net/). Once registered and logged in, the application allows users to browse Pinochio's Pizza's menu, add items to their cart and submit their order. All user accounts, menu items, user orders and items in users cart are stored in a Postgresql database. The contents of the order page and orders are dynamically generated by querying the database. Once an order is submitted, a confirmation email is sent to the user's email.

This application was built using Python and Django using Web Sockets with a HTML/CSS frontend.

In order to add toppings to a pizza, the user must have a pizza in their cart with toppings included. If they have reached the limit of allowed toppings, they are unable to add additional toppings until they remove a topping or add a new pizza. The same applies to extras for subs.
